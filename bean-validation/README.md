# This module showcases

## Custom validation levels and according actions 

In this case:
- MUST - if any failed, service doesn't proceed and returns 400
- WARN - warning message will be attached to response
- SILENT - no message attached
- if WARN or SILENT on the field - field will be dropped(to null) before service proceeds (config option to do this)

## Validation message

Individual field constraints have interpolated messages, including field name and value

Message is JSON map, including:
- description: what is this
- field: yielded by single-field constraints
- other

Showcase of cross-field constraint message going to "field": TODO

## Cases for validation

### Single field

- several simple validations, with different validation levels
- only for one service
- only in specific conditions (like only on POST request)
- only one service + conditional

### Class (cross-field)

- validate the field A with respect to B if field B is present
- if field B is absent, fail; or succeed
- cross-field constraint message should be able to go to "field" map

### Integration - speculative

Checks data against data supplied outside, or using DB

Examples: check if unique id(DB search);

check if all dependent records include relevant fields. 
This requires the supplied data from service(and same data used later),
as it can be very resource-consuming to pull data twice
 
- using DB
- using supplied data

## Conflict resolution

The field has MUST and WARN level invalidations

Example: String MUST be present, WARN be correct regex. 400, but is WARN included?

    No for that field

# Components

## frame
validation framework

Contains general validation annotations like @ValidEmail

---

## model

basic model, some is used in many services

### Classes, fields, constrains and constraint levels:

#### Email

String address
- MUST exist
- MUST compile email regex

String type
- MUST be one of: primary, work, other (any CAsE)
- default is "other"

#### Phone

String number

String type

Boolean primary

#### PersonalInformation

String firstName

String lastName

String fullName

List of Email emailList
- SHOULD not be empty 
- MUST contain exactly one address with type "primary" if more than one
- max length SHOULD be 3

List of Phone phoneList
TODO valid in country

String country

String passport

String gender

Date birthDate

Date marriageDate

#### User

String id

String name

String accessLevel

String status

String statusReason

PersonalInformation PiByUser

PersonalInformation PiByAgency

## service

services with different endpoints, methods.

Validation rules change accordingly

## test/practice

individual validation mechanics exploration
